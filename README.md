# üíª Installation

Please see the <a href="https://github.com/pacholoamit/pachtop/releases">releases</a> page for the latest version. Pachtop is available for <i>Windows, MacOS & Linux</i>

# üíØ Motivation

The inspiration for Pachtop stems mainly from using [Stacer](https://oguzhaninan.github.io/Stacer-Web/) which is a comprehensive System optimizer and monitoring solution. Although, Pachtop does not implement any system optimizer functionality (yet!), It provides more in-depth metrics and information about your system. I wanted to create a similar application to Stacer but with a more modern UI and a more robust codebase. I also wanted to learn Rust and this seemed like a good opportunity to do so. If you hadn't guessed, Pachtop is named after the legendary [top](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(software)>) linux program that displays information about CPU and memory utilization. Pachtop will always remain open-source and free to use.

# üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Pachtop is built with what I'd like to call the **"VRRTT"** stack (Vite, Rust, React, Typescript, Tauri.)

- **Vite** is a frontend build tool that uses **Rollup** under the hood. It's _blazingly fast_ and has a lot of cool features like hot module reloading and code splitting.
- **Rust** is a systems programming language that is _blazingly fast_ and memory efficient. Rust is also a very safe language and has a lot of cool features like ownership and borrowing which subsitutues the need for garbage collection.
- **React** is a popular frontend library that is used by many companies like Facebook, Netflix, Uber, etc.
- **Typescript** is a superset of Javascript that adds static typing to Javascript. It's very easy to learn and has a lot of great features.
- **Tauri** is a framework that allows you to build desktop applications with web technologies. Tauri allows us to create a pure Rust native OS webview, without the overhead of your average Electron app. This brings the bundle size and average memory usage down dramatically. It also contributes to a more native feel, especially on macOS due to Safari's close integration with the OS.
- **SysInfo** is a Rust crate that provides system information. This crate is used to get information about the system's CPU, memory, disks, network, and processes. This is what Pachtop uses to get the system metrics on different operating systems.
